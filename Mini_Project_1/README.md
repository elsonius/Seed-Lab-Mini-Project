# Seed-Lab-Mini-Project
The purpose for this mini project was to design a control system that rotates a wheel with a motor through the use of a Arduino, Raspberry Pi, encoder, and camera. The camera uses a system developed in Python to identify a Aruco marker within the four quadrents set up in the cameras view. Through the I2C communication between the Raspberry Pi and Arduino, the Raspberry Pi takes the position data and send it to the Arduino. The Arduino uses this data and accuratly positions the wheel according to the quadrant the Aruco marker position. The Arduino is able to perform this task because data obtained by the PID loop. The PID loop model was designed using MATLAB and Simulink, and simulated various sets of responses to find the most accurate response for the proper rotation of the wheel. The Arduino folder has all the Arduino code that is well commented and what was used in the operation of the mini project. The MATLAB folder contains the simulation and MATLAB code needed for the mini project to operate. Lastly, the PI folder contains all the well commented python code for the mini project.
